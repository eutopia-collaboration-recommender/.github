# EUTOPIA Collaboration Recommender

<hr/>

## Project Introduction

This repository contains the code for the EUTOPIA collaboration recommender system.

In today's academic landscape, collaboration across disciplines and institutions is crucial due to complex scientific
papers. Yet, such collaboration is often underused, leading to isolated researchers and few connected hubs. This thesis
aims to create a system for proposing new partnerships based on research interests and trends, enhancing academic
cooperation. It focuses on building a network from scientific co-authorships and a recommender system for future
collaborations. Emphasis is on improving the EUTOPIA organization by fostering valuable, interdisciplinary academic
relationships.

The system consist of three main components:

1. **Luigi pipeline for data ingestion and
   transformation**: [ecr-luigi :octocat:](https://github.com/eutopia-collaboration-recommender/ecr-luigi).
2. **Analytical layer for gaining a deeper understanding of the
   data**: [ecr-analytics :octocat:](https://github.com/eutopia-collaboration-recommender/ecr-analytics).
3. **Recommender system for proposing new
   collaborations**: [ecr-recommender :octocat:](https://github.com/eutopia-collaboration-recommender/ecr-recommender).
